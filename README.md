project for arcane

1st : I chose to use a .csv database (text file that can be exported as an excel file easy to use).
      There will be two databases, one for the users and one for the goods. 
      Each user is unique, has a unique user_id and must log in with a password to access features such as creating, updating or consulting a good.
      Each good is unique, has a unique good_id and user_id (landlord). The only search key when you search a good among the database is the city.

2st : stating the app endpoints (create functions, edit functions and consult function)

3st : coding the functions
